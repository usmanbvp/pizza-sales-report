## üîÑ Data Transformation

### SQL Analysis

The raw data was first processed using SQL, with the following key transformations:
 <ul>
 <li> <b>Data Cleaning: </b>  Removed duplicates and handled missing values.</li>

 <li> <b> Metric Calculations:</b> Calculated key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and profit margins. </li>

<li> <b>Data Aggregation: </b> Grouped data by various dimensions (e.g., date, pizza category) to prepare for analysis in Power BI. </li>

 </ul>

### Power BI Processing

After SQL processing, the data was imported into Power BI for further analysis. In Power BI, additional transformations were applied:

- <b>Calculated Columns:</b> Created columns for metrics like sales growth and customer lifetime value.
